# Writing samples

Take a look at these samples.



## Markdown Enricher docs

I developed a Python-based CI/CD pre-processing tool for markdown. Our team needed to single-source markdown files, share them across services, and deliver them to different downstream public and enterprise Github repositories. It includes content parsing, a variety of content validation steps, and  both CLI and API calls for failover attempts to deliver the files.

Though this documentation is maintained and developed internally at IBM, the Markdown Enricher is used to provide a subset of the documentation externally.

## IBM Cloud InstructLab Service docs

My introduction to large-language modeling for AI has been through writing documentation for the IBM Cloud InstructLab Service.

## Troubleshooting topic example

For the IBM Cloud InstructLab Service troubleshooting docs, I was given the following information from development.

```
Failed to read secret data from secrets manager. Double check the authorization policy and that the secret exists.

```

I turned that information into the following topic.
