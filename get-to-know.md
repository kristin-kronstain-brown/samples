# Get to know Kristin Brown

Here are some common professional ice breaker questions to get to know Kristin a little better.

## What led you to pursue your current profession?

I studied history in college because I loved hearing stories about people, learning what motivated them to make decisions, and seeing what the consequences were. But just as much, I enjoyed writing about those stories. I enjoyed the process of organizing information in a way that could be categorized and structured to ensure clarity and support an argument. Technical writing was a natural transition from that study.


## Have you ever had a mentor who made a significant impact on your career? 

For about 2 years, my team had a content strategist who provided direction and encouragement to us. She pushed automation as vital to the development of technical documentation. In my early career, I was someone who was comfortable running things from the command line, but creating something myself? I had never considered it. 

This priority shift gave me new excitement for the speed in which I could get changes out and the quality of content I could produce. I am still grateful for the push to learn how to automate tasks.


## What is one skill or expertise that you bring to the table in your current role? 

Positivity. I am a team player and am always looking for ways to support my own and other teams the best that I can with the most positivity I can. 

The dev team needs help setting up Jenkins jobs for a few weeks to make a deadline? I'm in. Can you fill in for someone on maternity leave by answering questions in their Slack channels? You got it. Can you share a script you developed so it can be adapted for something else? Take it. Can you come up along side this new writer and help them get started? Let's set up a time. 

Whatever it is, let's find a solution that makes our processes or products better for us and our customers.


## What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your professional life, and how did you overcome it?

When my kids were born, I wanted to work part-time. My manager was incredibly encouraging about this decision, however, I would not be able to continue being a team lead. I did not want to give up that role, but it was best for my family and my team at that time. 

One of the writers on my team was given the lead position and I remained on the team with an advisory role. This setup could have been fraught with issues. We both worked hard to work well together. He grew into a fantastic leader and I am so proud of how well he continues to lead our team.
